            Matix is a little OpenGL library developed by a 17yo (february 2024) french guy.</br>
            It's created for fun and to be shared. Because of the tiny experience of its developer, it mays not be perfect everywhere.</br></br>
            The goal with this library is to allow 3D display and basics 2D display easily.</br>
            It uses C++ and OpenGL to work. To use OpenGL with C++, GLFW, ModernGL and Glad are used. Some other libraries like stb_image are also used.
