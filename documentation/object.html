        <h1>Matix - Object</h1>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <div>
            An Object is something used in a <a href="scene.html">scene</a>.</br>
            Each objects has a transformation, and can have (or not) a graphic apparence and a physic part.</br>
        </div>
        <h2>Transform Object</h2>
        <div>
            Each object has a transformation. A transformation represents a position, a rotation and a scale.</br>
            The transformation can also includes a parent, which will apply its transformation to its son.</br>
            <h3>Position handle</h3>
            <div>
                The position handling is the easiest handling in the transform.</br>
                Each object has a local position, in its parents.</br>
                All the transformations to the object start from an anchored position, except the ones coming from the parent.</br>
                To not interfere with the local position, this kind of position are located in a position offset (one for parent and one for anchor).</br>
                The object can add all that to have its absolute position in the scene.</br>
                The parent absolute position is also added into the calcul of the object absolute position.</br>
            </div>
            <h3>Rotation handle</h3>
            <div>

            </div>
